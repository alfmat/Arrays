# Java Programs
This repository is a collection of various Java files that I created for my AP Computer Science A class in high school

## Folders
Descriptions of all the folders and what you can find in them

### RPSFiles
This folder actually contains a project that I worked on my own. It demonstrates some of the concepts of OOP and is a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors

### Arrays
These are mostly programs that I built in APCS for demonstrating the functionality of Arrays

### ProgramsUsingStrings
APCS programs that were used to experiment and better understand String concepts

### UsingLoops
Understanding the functionality and applications of while and for loops

### AlgebraBasedPrograms
Files for APCS that required arithmetic and algebraic calculations.
These programs usually focussed on looking at some data and performing some sort of analysis on it, usually finding the mean/max/min of the data passed into the program

## Dependencies
The key is to have Java running on the machine that you may wish to use these programs on. 
Apart from this fundamental requirement, a basic text editor is all that should be required
